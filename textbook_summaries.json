        "title": "Specific Syndromes Causing Acute Intrinsic Renal Failure",
        "content": "The chapter \"Specific Syndromes Causing Acute Intrinsic Renal Failure\" in Canine and Feline Nephrology and Urology (Second Edition) provides an in-depth examination of various conditions leading to acute intrinsic renal failure (AIRF) in dogs and cats. It delves into the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies for each syndrome.\n\n## Key Syndromes Discussed:\n\n### 1. Ethylene Glycol (EG) Toxicity:\n   - Introduction and Pathophysiology: EG ingestion is a significant cause of AIRF in dogs and cats, often resulting from exposure to antifreeze. The toxicity is dose-dependent, with metabolites causing renal damage.\n   - Clinical Signs: Early symptoms include vomiting, depression, and ataxia, progressing to severe renal failure if untreated.\n   - Diagnosis: Based on history of exposure, clinical signs, and laboratory findings such as metabolic acidosis and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in urine.\n   - Treatment: Prompt administration of antidotes like fomepizole or ethanol, along with supportive care, is crucial.\n\n### 2. Nephrotoxicity from Aminoglycosides:\n   - Introduction and Pathophysiology: Aminoglycoside antibiotics can induce renal tubular damage, leading to AIRF.\n   - Clinical Signs: Often subtle, including increased thirst and urination, with progression to more severe renal dysfunction.\n   - Diagnosis: Monitoring serum drug levels and renal function tests.\n   - Treatment: Discontinuation of the drug and supportive renal therapy.\n\n### 3. Leptospirosis:\n   - Introduction and Pathophysiology: A bacterial infection causing interstitial nephritis and potential renal failure.\n   - Clinical Signs: Fever, muscle pain, vomiting, and signs of renal failure.\n   - Diagnosis: Serological tests and PCR for Leptospira spp.\n   - Treatment: Antibiotic therapy combined with supportive care.\n\n### 4. Hypercalcemia-Induced Renal Failure:\n   - Introduction and Pathophysiology: Elevated calcium levels can lead to renal vasoconstriction and tubular damage.\n   - Clinical Signs: Polyuria, polydipsia, anorexia, and lethargy.\n   - Diagnosis: Serum calcium measurement and assessment of underlying causes.\n   - Treatment: Addressing the underlying cause and managing hypercalcemia.\n\n### 5. Hemoglobinuria/Myoglobinuria:\n   - Introduction and Pathophysiology: Release of hemoglobin or myoglobin can cause renal tubular obstruction and damage.\n   - Clinical Signs: Dark urine, muscle pain (in myoglobinuria), and signs of renal failure.\n   - Diagnosis: Urinalysis revealing pigmented casts and elevated muscle enzymes in myoglobinuria.\n   - Treatment: Aggressive fluid therapy and addressing the underlying cause.\n\nThe chapter emphasizes the importance of early recognition and intervention in these syndromes to prevent irreversible renal damage. It also highlights the need for preventive measures, such as proper storage of toxic substances and cautious use of nephrotoxic drugs.",
